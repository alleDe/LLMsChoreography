# LLMs Choreography

Supplementary material for the paper titled "Large Language Models for Human-AI Co-Creation of Robotic Dance Performances":

1) The 'Domain Setting' folder contains the Python scripts for each robot position executable on NAO robot. \\
   We also provide a short video demo for the more complex positions (e.g., birthday_dance).

2) The 'Prompting' folder contains the script for running all the prompting techniques by using gpt3.5-turbo. \\
   We also add a .txt file with all the tested prompts for each music genre and prompting technique.

3) The 'Results' folder contains: \\
   a) the dataset describing the scores the evaluation audience;
   b) the videos of the outputs generated by our three prompting techniques for the Latin music genre;
   c) the textual outputs of the choreographies generated by all the tested prompts for each music genre and each prompting technique.
